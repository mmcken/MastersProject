# MastersProject

1. Install Meteor:
https://www.meteor.com/install

2. Download the project.

3. Check the correct installation by using "meteor" command on your terminal. This would prompt you to create a project or to use the --help to know more about meteor.

4. To run the meteor project, get into the project folder and use
  "meteor run" command on your terminal to run the project.
  
5. Running the application is easy. However, I have provided a detailed video on how the application is run and how the querying is performed at https://youtu.be/XaldgIthVig
